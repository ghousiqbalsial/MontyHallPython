# MontyHallPython

This is a simulation of the famous Monty Hall Problem. This simulation employs the "Always Switch" strategy to calculate the winning chances. In this strategy, the game host reveals a goat after contestant's initial choice and presents them with a choice to switch. The contestant always chooses to switch the door when presented with the opportunity.

This simulation uses the tkinter library to display the result in a window. If you do not have tkinter installed, you can do so by the following command in the terminal in Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install python3-tk
```
